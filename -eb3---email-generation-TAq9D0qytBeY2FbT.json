Review lead data sources, including Personal Bio, Company About, Recent Company Posts, Company Homepage and anything else provided.\n\n2. Identify compelling details that show we’ve “done our homework” and will help connect the lead to \"Our Offer\" in a natural way.\n\n3. Provide a highly detailed report in bullet points of the best ways to connect with the lead. It must show that we understand them as a person, the business, and position us as an ally. This may include:\n- Compelling insights\n- Quotes\n- Powerful angles to frame our offer\n- Tap into the lead's pain points\n- Align with their beliefs\n- Do not explicitly reference \"AI\" or \"SMS\", instead refer to it as the offer\n\n4. At the end of the report, include a brief recommendations section to provide nuanced insights from your research. \n\n\n\n\n#Notes:\n- Non-negotiable: Do not use — (em dash)\n- Don't assume the business belongs to the lead (unless their title is \"owner\", or they share the same name as the business, other other clear indication.)\n\n\n\n#Guidelines: \n- Each key insight should be concise and include brief context, details, and why it would be valuable in our outreach.\n- Keep each insight actionable, and relevant. Prioritize recency, relevance, and uniqueness.\n- If/when referencing \"Current experience\" ensure \n that \"Current Experience\":\"True\" (not \"False\")\n (Unless they are the owner, or share the same name as the business)\n- Remain objective and avoid making assumptions (e.g \"lead cuold free up 20+ hours/month\", but no hard evidence to support it)\n- As an industry expert, pick up on details (e.g. Prospects for EVs  often require 2-3x more follow-up due to longer decision cycles about charging infrastructure and new technology)\n\n\n\n#Rules:\n- Include small, non-obvious things to paraphrase. The idea is to make people think we *really* dove deep into their LinkedIn and company, so don't use something obvious.\n- Only include post that are under 4 weeks old from todays date: {{ $now }}\n- Avoid stating if something is \"new\" or \"recent\" unless it is explicitly under 3 months old.\n- Only include info that is genuinely useful for personalizing a message\n- Avoid fluff (e.g. “loves dogs” from LinkedIn bio, unless it's genuinely relevant)\n\n\n\n\n#Output\n- Provide 4-5 insights in a formatted document:\n\n\n#Lead Research: (Lead Name goes here)\n\nInsight {1}: {\"Overview of the insight. Context of why it's important to mention in our outreach. Distilled, accurate and valuable\" goes here}\nRelevance: {\"high - reason why, medium - reason why, low - reason why\" goes here}\nSource: {\"Personal bio, company website, company Linkedin\"}\n\n\n\n\n<examples>\n\n#Relevance examples\nBelow are some examples of how the insights should be ranked for relevance.\n\nHigh Relevance:\n- Promotion/new job (Must be under <3 months to state it's \"new\" or  \"recent\")\n- Launched a new initiative\n- Has the pain points we solve\n- Lead change and adoption of new tech, process, mindset\n- Hiring highly relevant department such as sales, marketing, customer service, etc\n\n\nMedium Relevance:\n- Got award\n- Long time in the job (10+ years)\n- Family owned\n- Based in X location\n- Loves dogs\n- Has a specific hobby\n\n\nLow Relevance:\n- Does team training\n- Good at customer service\n- Hiring in unreleated departments \n\n</examples>\n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n#Lead Data Sources\n\nLead Name: {{ $json.firstName }} {{

Newer is better.\n- The email should feel genuinely personal and tightly relevant\n- Your tone of voice should be \"casual bar conversation\" and very spartan. No fancy language.\n- Keep variables SHORT and punchy\n- Never mention \"database\"\n- Don't change 'subjectLine' from the template, make sure {thingAboutThem} is about them and KEEP the \"re:\" (Don't reference the offer or sound salesy - such as, \"leads\", \"AI\", \"SMS\",\"follow-ups\" etc.)\n- Always start with \"Love {thing}\"\n- Always include the proof: \"just helped a similar dealership generate {46} extra appointments and {8} sales last month + saved over {50} hours of manual follow-up.\"\n- Always include: {someImpliedBeliefTheyHave}\n- Don't use wimisical phrases (e.g. \"It makes me wonder: What if every missed lead was a neighbor we failed?\")\n\n\n#Guidelines:\n- Personalization should be tight, but not creepy.\n- Try to connect the subjectLine to the intro so the email flows naturally.\n- Prioritize higher-relevance insights for variables\n- Try and avoid low relevance insights \n- {personalThing} should be something unique about them them or their life ideally from \"Personal Bio\"\n- {leadSummary} is a used in a follow up email and should stand out and being highly personal and relevant.\n- Weave in multiple insights from the lead research\n- Try avoid using the same insight more than twice in the \"emailBody\"\n- Pick up on industry knowledge (e.g. EV's in dealership have longer sales cycle, etc)\n\n\n\n#Rules:\n- Make sure to use the above templates when constructing your the email. We wrote it this way on purpose.\n- Don't assume the business belongs to the lead (unless their title is \"owner\", or they share the same name as the business, other other clear indication.)\n- Shorten the company name wherever possible (say, \"XYZ\" instead of \"XYZ Agency\"). More examples: \"Love AMS\" instead of \"Love AMS Professional Services\", \"Love Mayo\" instead of \"Love Mayo Inc\", \"Claremont\" insted of \"Claremont Insurance Services\" etc.\n- Do the same with locations. \"San Fran\" instead of \"San Francisco\", \"BC\" instead of \"British Columbia\", etc.\n- Do not just repeat the input data verbatim. Paraphrase, so they think a human wrote it.\n- Make sure the \"subjectLine\" is non-capitalized, even if it’s grammatically incorrect. This makes the email seem more human.\n- Avoid using superscript, subscript or ™, ©, ;, and other signs that look copy and pasted.\n- Avoid suggesting we should have a \"call\"\n- Use shortened abbreviation and lowercase for {Position/Title} (e.g. Director of Business Development = director of BD. CEO = CEO)\n- Avoid congratulations for promotions, unless it was less than 3 months ago.\n- Avoid calculating potentional savings and sales.\n"},{"content":"=#Lead Details:\n\nLead Name: {{ $('researchData').item.json.firstName }} {{ $('researchData').item.json.lastName }}\n\nLead Title: {{ $('researchData').item.json.title }}\n\nLead Headline: {{ $('researchData').item.json.headline }}\n\nOrganization Name: {{ $('researchData').item.json.organizationName }}\n\nThe following lead research has been put together by your research team:\n{{ $json.leadResearch }}\n"},{"content":"#Example Email Output\n\n\nsubjectLine: hey shiraz, think I have something for your ev & hybrid lead strategy\n\n\nemailBody: I know you're doing a killer job expanding CardinaleWay's EV lineup with 17+ electric/hybrid models, and love how you're prioritizing relationships that outlast the car.
